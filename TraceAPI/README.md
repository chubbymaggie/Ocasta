# TraceAPI
TraceAPI is a tool that intercepts Windows API calls, particularly registry calls, and logs all changes to Windows registry from user applications. 

This set of tools has been used for the publication of "Ocasta: Clustering Configuration Settings for Error Recovery" in the proceedings of the 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN2014).
