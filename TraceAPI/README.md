# Ocasta
Project Ocasta consists of a set of low-level system tools including monitors for Linux system calls and Windows API calls, a versioning key-value database, and utilities for a versioning file system.

This set of tools has been used for the publication of "Ocasta: Clustering Configuration Settings for Error Recovery" in the proceedings of the 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN2014).
