Timetravelstore is a versioned key-value database based on redis. It provides a set of API functions for C++ programs to access and update the database. It keeps all the historic values associated with a key and allows an user to rollback to any of the previous values. It also keeps track of the time for each update to a value and allows an user to retrieve any historic value that was updated at a specific time. To faciliate search in the database, it provides an API function to retrive the name of keys that match a string pattern. Last but not least, it supports both Linux/Unix and Windows.
