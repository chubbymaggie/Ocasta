This is the installation guide for Ocasta's Linux system call logger, kernel_logger, which intercept system calls and save information about the system calls into log files. It consists of a kernel module and a loader executable.

1. Build and install the kernel module and loader executable

$ cd kernel_logger
$ make
$ sudo make install 

2. Start the kernel logging

$ sudo /etc/init.d/ocasta start

3. Check the status of the kernel_logger

$ cat /proc/audit

4. Stop the kernel logging

$ sudo /etc/init.d/ocasta stop

5. Format of a log file

The log files are stored under /etc/ocasta directory and the format of the log files are declared in ocasta_dat.h. Each log file is composed of a header and a number of log entries, each corresponds to a system call. 

Both the header and log entry are defined in ocasta_dat.h. The header contains a string signature and the version of the kernel_logger, and the size of each log entry. And information about each logged system call consists of a log entry, which contains information such as the pid of the process that issues the system call, the pathname of the file being written if the system call writes to a file, followed by the actual data being written.
