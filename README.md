# Ocasta
This project consists of a set of system tools including monitors for Linux system calls, Windows API calls and gconf API calls, a versioning key-value database, and utilities for versioning files.

This set of tools has been used to collect changes made by OS and user applications to file system and Windows registry from dozens of Debian desktops and several Windows desktops for several months, for the publication of "Ocasta: Clustering Configuration Settings for Error Recovery" in the proceedings of the 44th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN2014).
